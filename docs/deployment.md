## Template
The following is the template used to deploy the ASB:
 * [deploy-ansible-service-broker.template.yaml](../templates/deploy-ansible-service-broker.template.yaml)

### Launch APB on Bind Parameter
Currently, we are ***disabling*** running an APB on `Bind()` due to the lack of async support of bind in the Open Service Broker API.  This is achieved via `launchapbonbind` which is currently set to `false`.  You may enable launching of APB on Bind by changing it to `true`.  However, since there is a timeout of ~15 seconds asserted from the Service Catalog, you will likely see failures running an APB.
